<p>League of Legends is a MOBA(Multiplayer Online Battle Arena). Their champion variety is the one of the most varied I have ever seen.
	<br>All the champions each have their specific role in the team comp. There are five general roles.
	<ol>
		<li>Top</li><li>Jungle</li><li>Mid</li><li>Marksman</li><li>Support</li>
		</ol>
		<br>There might be 148 champions in their repertoire,<em>however</em> they are all finely tuned for a well-balanced game
		<br>One of my favorite champions, Aphelios, has been seeing the stage almost every game in the pro league. He is either picked or banned in all the regions of the world.
		<br>What I love about his kit is that even if he has only two buttons to push, his first ability(Q) has a multitude of different abliities.</p>
